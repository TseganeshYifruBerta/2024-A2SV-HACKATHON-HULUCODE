Problem-Solving with AI: Helping African Education System 


HULU CODE is an innovative web-based educational platform designed to enhance programming education by providing an interactive, user-friendly environment. This project aims to address the challenges faced by students and educators in the fields of Software Engineering and computer science. HULU CODE offers a centralized platform with various features and functionalities to make learning and teaching more efficient, consistent, and engaging. Currently, the platform is partially implemented and does not include AI capabilities. However, we are now planning to add new AI-driven features to further enhance its functionality. These AI features will include an interactive chatbot for student support, automated grading systems, and advanced plagiarism detection, making HULU CODE even more powerful and effective for both students and educators.
